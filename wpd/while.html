<h1 style="color:blue;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;border: 4px solid dodgerblue;"> While Loop In C</h1>
<p> Syntax of the While loop is:-<br>
<p style="background-color:skyblue;"><b>while (condition){<h2 style="font-size:120%;">statements</h2>}
</b></p>
It is an entry-controlled loop. In while loop, a condition is evaluated before processing a body of the loop. If a condition is true then and only then the body of a loop is executed. After the body of a loop is executed then control again goes back at the beginning, and the condition is checked if it is true, the same process is executed until the condition becomes false. Once the condition becomes false, the control goes out of the loop.

After exiting the loop, the control goes to the statements which are immediately after the loop. The body of a loop can contain more than one statement. If it contains only one statement, then the curly braces are not compulsory. It is a good practice though to use the curly braces even we have a single statement in the body.

In while loop, if the condition is not true, then the body of a loop will not be executed, not even once. It is different in do while loop which we will see shortly.<br>

<p> <ul>
<li>A conditional expression is used to check the condition. The statements defined inside the while loop will repeatedly execute until the given condition fails.</li>
<li>The condition will be true if it returns 0. The condition will be false if it returns any non-zero number.</li>
<li>In while loop, the condition expression is compulsory.</li>
<li>Running a while loop without a body is possible.</li>
<li>We can have more than one conditional expression in while loop.</li>
<li>If the loop body contains only one statement, then the braces are optional.</li>
</ul>
