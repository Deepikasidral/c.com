<h1 style="color:green;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;border: 4px solid dodgerblue;"> Do While Loop In C</h1>
<p>The do while loop is a post tested loop. Using the do-while loop, we can repeat the execution of several parts of the statements. The do-while loop is mainly used in the case where we need to execute the loop at least once. The do-while loop is mostly used in menu-driven programs where the termination condition depends upon the end user.</p>
<p><b>Syntax of Do while loop is:-  <br>
<p style="background-color:yellow;"><b>do{<h2 style="font-size:120%;background-color:yellow;">while (condition);</h2><h3 style="background-color:yellow;">}</h3></b></p>

<p><ul>
<li>In the do-while loop, the body of a loop is always executed at least once. After the body is executed, then it checks the condition. If the condition is true, then it will again execute the body of a loop otherwise control is transferred out of the loop.</li>

<li>Similar to the while loop, once the control goes out of the loop the statements which are immediately after the loop is executed.</li>

<li>The critical difference between the while and do-while loop is that in while loop the while is written at the beginning. In do-while loop, the while condition is written at the end and terminates with a semi-colon (;).</li>

<h6 style="color:DodgerBlue;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;border: 4px solid red;"> Program using do-while loop</h6>

<p style="color:olive;text-align:center;font-family:tempus san;font-size:200%;">Running of program<ul>
<li>First, we have initialized a variable ‘num’ with value 1. Then we have written a do-while loop.</li>
<li>In a loop, we have a print function that will print the series by multiplying the value of num with 2.</li>
<li>After each increment, the value of num will increase by 1, and it will be printed on the screen.</li>
<li>Initially, the value of num is 1. In a body of a loop, the print function will be executed in this way: 2*num where num=1, then 2*1=2 hence the value two will be printed. This will go on until the value of num becomes 10. After that loop will be terminated and a statement which is immediately after the loop will be executed. In this case return 0.</li>
