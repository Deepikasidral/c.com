<p style="background-image:url('C:\Users\User\Desktop\New folder\wpd 1.png');">Looping Statements in C execute the sequence of statements many times until the stated condition becomes false. A loop in C consists of two parts, a body of a loop and a control statement. The control statement is a combination of some conditions that direct the body of the loop to execute until the specified condition becomes false. The purpose of the C loop is to repeat the same code a number of times.<br>
<h2 style="color:magenta;font_family:tempus sans;text-align: center;font-size:200%;border: 4px solid dodgerblue;"> TYPES OF LOOPING IN 'C'.</h2>
<p>Depending upon the position of a control statement in a program, looping statement in C is classified into two types:

<h3 style="color:brown;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:100%;">>1. Entry controlled loop</h3>

<h4 style="color:brown;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:100%;">>2. Exit controlled loop</h4>

In an entry control loop in C, a condition is checked before executing the body of a loop. It is also called as a pre-checking loop.

In an exit controlled loop, a condition is checked after executing the body of a loop. It is also called as a post-checking loop.<br>

    <td>In while loop, a condition is evaluated before processing a body of the loop. If a condition is true then and only then the body of a loop is executed.</td>

    <td>Do-While Loop</td>
    <td>In a do…while loop, the condition is always executed after the body of a loop. It is also called an exit-controlled loop.</td>

    <td>3</td>
    <td>For Loop</td>
    <td>In a for loop, the initial value is performed only once, then the condition tests and compares the counter to a fixed value after each iteration, stopping the for loop when false is returned.</td>
