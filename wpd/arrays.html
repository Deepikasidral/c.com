<p>Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.<br>

Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.<br>

All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.</p>

<h2 style="color:violet;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;border: 4px solid red;">Declaring arrays</h2>
<p>To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows -</p>
<p style="background-color:yellow;"><b>type arrayName [ arraySize ];</b></p>
<h3 style="color:olive;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;border: 4px solid dodgerblue;"> Initializing of an Array</h3>
<p>The simplest way to initialize an array is by using the index of each element. We can initialize each element of the array by using the index. Consider the following example.</p>
<h4>marks[0]=80;//initialization of array</h4>
<h5 font-size:100%;">marks[1]=60;</h5>
<h6 font-size:200%;">marks[2]=70;</h6>
<h7 font-size:200%;">marks[3]=85;</h7>
<h8 font-size:200%;">marks[4]=75;</h8><br>

<h9 style="color:blue;text-align:center;font-family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;border:4px solid dodgerblue;"> Information about the array:-</h9>
<p>C array is beneficial if you have to store similar elements. For example, if we want to store the marks of a student in 6 subjects, then we don't need to define different variables for the marks in the different subject. Instead of that, we can define an array which can store the marks in each subject at the contiguous memory locations.

By using the array, we can access the elements easily. Only a few lines of code are required to access the elements of the array.</p>
<h10 style="color:olive;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;border: 4px solid red;"> Types of an array</h10>
<p><b> Single Dimentional Array</b><br>
<b> Multi or two Dimentional Array</b></p>
<p> We have seen the single dimentional array above , now let's see the 2D array!</p>
<h11 style="color:red;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;"> Multidimentional or 2D Array</h11>
<p>An array of arrays is called as multi dimensional array. In simple words, an array created with more than one dimension (size) is called as multi dimensional array. Multi dimensional array can be of two dimensional array or three dimensional array or four dimensional array or more...

Most popular and commonly used multi dimensional array is two dimensional array. The 2-D arrays are used to store data in the form of table. We also use 2-D arrays to create mathematical matrices.</p>
<p><b>Declaration of 2D array</b></p>
<p style="background-color:yellow;"><b>int matrix_A [2][3] ;</b></p>
<h12 style="color:orange;text-align: center;font_family:tempus sans;font-size:200%;"> Charcter arrays</h12>
<p style="color:blue;border: 2px solid red;"><b> Arrays with characters are known as 'String'. Examples of string is our name or anything which is in character i.e letter form.Let's see the detail about the strings.</b></p>
